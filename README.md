# my NGS analysis

This repo aims to put in the same place the sbatch scripts to run analysis on cluster and the galaxy workflows.

Most of galaxy workflows has been transfered to [iwc](https://github.com/galaxyproject/iwc/)

You can easily get them from the dockstore:
- [epigenetics workflows](https://dockstore.org/organizations/iwc/collections/epigenetics)
- [transcriptomics workflows](https://dockstore.org/organizations/iwc/collections/transcriptomics)

You can also see them on [iwc website](https://iwc.galaxyproject.org/).

There is also [a directory](./containers/) about containers and how to run RStudio server on clusters.

There is [another one](./cluster) with files I put in my home of a cluster with slurm.
