# my NGS analysis

This repo aims to put in the same place the sbatch scripts to run analysis on cluster and the galaxy workflows.

Most of galaxy workflows has been transfered to [iwc](https://github.com/galaxyproject/iwc/)

You can easily get them from the dockstore:
- [epigenetics workflows](https://dockstore.org/organizations/iwc/collections/epigenetics)
- [transcriptomics workflows](https://dockstore.org/organizations/iwc/collections/transcriptomics)
